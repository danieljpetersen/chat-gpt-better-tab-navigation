# chat-gpt-better-tab-navigation
I have been continually annoyed at how bad ChatGPT's UI is for navigation. I just want to use arrow keys to be able to move up and down the page. I just want to easily move focus through their copy code buttons.

This is a Tampermonkey script aiming to allow me to do just that.
